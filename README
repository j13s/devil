This is an in progress port of Devil from DOS to Linux.  It crashes and
is not usable yet.  There are also specific paths to libraries in the
Makefiles that will cause errors.  Change these to point to your
libraries.

Depends:
- Allegro 4.2.2
- GRX 2.4.8
- libtap (for testing, can be grabbed from CCAN)
