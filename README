This is an in progress port of Devil from DOS to Linux.  There are 
specific paths to libraries in the Makefiles that will cause errors.
Change these to point to your libraries.

Depends:
- Allegro 4.2.2
- GRX 2.4.8
- libtap (for testing, can be grabbed from CCAN)

To use Devil:

- Install Descent or Descent 2. The shareware versions should also work
but I am not sure since I have not tested them.

- Download the binary distribution of Devil 2.2lc2 and decompress.
- Download the source from the repository and build the devil
  executable.
- Place the devil executable in the devil-2.2lc2 directory and run. Some
  filenames will have to be transliterated to their lowercase
  equivalents.
- Run devil and set your path to the Descent or Descent 2 directory and
  exit.
